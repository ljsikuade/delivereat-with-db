# Delivereat - Weekend Project
A takeaway website. Add and remove orders to/from a basket and get
a calculation of order-time based on the distance between the app owner's
postcode and the user's. 

Final order requests are handled by a back end which includes a database, and confirmation
is sent back to the user.
